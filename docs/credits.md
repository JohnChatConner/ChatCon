ChatCon came in a revelation after reading about Ailey & Bailey, the system developed by Reddit user [u/Unhappy_Pass4734](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unhappy_Pass4734/).

With the help of Claude.ai (and without which none of this could have come about), I emailed `Unhappy_Pass4734` and showed them my first attempt at ChatCon (which wasn't even called ChatCon in the beginning.) Their encouragement was wonderfully uplifting, and I'm happy and thrilled to give them full credit for inspiring the development of ChatCon.

If you're interested in pursuing [personalized learning and skill development](cool things.md/#personalized-learning-and-skill-development) with an AI continuity system, you can't do much better than with [Ailey & Bailey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qcvTO--hRtRnuzpU6tTUW9YWwrnN1yTR/view?usp=sharing), a massive learning, state management, context, and continuity system by which ChatCon pales in comparison. Check it out!
